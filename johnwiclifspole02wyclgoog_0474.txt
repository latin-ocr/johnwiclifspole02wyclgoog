Mr. J. H. Hessnns 01 Cambridge is preparing the De
Actibus Animoe3 but it is s very diffieult treatise, and he
wishes to give it the time necessary for a satisfactory under-
standing of the scholastio philosop y involved init.

Now ii the Members of the Society will only bestir them·
selves and raise 51000 for the Quinoentensry 01 Wrcnrr’s
death, all these works, and more, oan be printed and issued
next year. The truest honour that can be paid to erurr's
memory; is to print his words, the reoords 01 his thou hus,
which, to the disgraoe 01 every Englishman, have hoen
leit unheeded in foreign librarios for now five hundred
years The monument ‘aare pereamus! which Germany is
now erecting to the memory of her Lurrrnn, is a new critical
edition oi Luther’s Works, of which⁸ the first volume was
issued on the day of the Luther Centenary, November 10,
1883. And till 011 our great Reiormer's most important
Traatises are in print, no question of monument or other
memorial to him need be raised. The Committee therefore
repeat irom tha Sooiety’s Pro tus their “appeal to all
who oare lor the Religion, the weedom, the Languuge, and
the History oi England, -for aid in the work they 'have
undertaken. No party feeling whatever enters into the
Sooiety’s plan. The only desire is, to do England's long·
neglected duty to the memory of a great English Worth .''
